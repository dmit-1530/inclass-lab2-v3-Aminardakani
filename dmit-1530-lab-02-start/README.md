## Lab 02 - Responsive Flexbox Layout with Media Queries

This In-Class Lab is worth 5% of your overall grade.

You must be present in class in order to receive credit. 


## Instructions

Your task is to create a fully responsive layout using flexbox and multiple media queries. You have been given all of the markup and images required to complete this task. Do not alter the structure of the HTML or add any classes to its elements; the only thing you should change is the authorial information in the `<head>`.

Your CSS must follow a mobile-first methodology and use top-down logic in order to create a solution that looks as reasonably close to the provided screenshots as possible. 


## Methodology 

1. Change the content of the `author` meta tag in the `<head>` of the HTML.

2. Although you do not need to write any further markup, study the structure of the HTML in order to familiarise yourself with the document and what selector statements you will need to write in your CSS. 

3. Begin your CSS with the most general or universal styles, followed by utility classes. 

4. Write and complete the styles required for the mobile (smallest) layout. 

5. Choose a size for your first media query (for the tablet or 'medium' layout). Write the required changes or additions to the styles that you need.

6. Choose a size for the final media query (for the desktop or 'large' layout). Write the required changes or additions to the styles that you need.


## Marking Guide

You will be awarded five (5) marks for a total of 5% of your overall grade. Your instructor will be checking to make sure that the following tasks are completed.

1. The CSS follows a mobile-first development methodology.

2. The minimum widths for each media query are appropriate for the provided content. 

3. The mobile, tablet, and desktop views (or the small, medium, and large views) closely resemble the provided screenshots. 

4. The first article's layout changes in the first media query. There are the correct amount of columns per row in each view.

In addition to these tasks, your solution must look as reasonably close to the provided screenshots as possible. Your solution must also follow all current best practices for the web. This means that your solution must also incorporate concepts previously introduced in this course, such as maximum-wodth containers and relative units of measurement.

**Note**: Your HTML and CSS must be valid - that is, your code must pass W3C Validation - in order to receive credit for this Lab.
